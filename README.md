# Adaptive Learning Python Simulation

This repository contains a preliminary simulation of Adaptive Learning before deployment to a Cable-Driven Rehabilitation Robot.

- **`adaptive_learning.ipynb`** updates the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) to help humans track a reference force while maintaining sufficient compliance.
- **`fsm.ipynb`** implements a naive rule-based algorithm that does not effectively track the reference trajectory.

For more details, check out the [Algorithm Guide](./Algorithm_Guide.pdf).
